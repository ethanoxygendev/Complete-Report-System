A complete report system using threads, context menu action (can be easily converted into a slash command) and embeds.
It uses a custom command/event handler but i think you can use it quite anywhere with just a few modifications.
It's not the best code ever, but i think it could be useful to many of you, although it doesn't have any Database support for now cause i don't think it is really needed
